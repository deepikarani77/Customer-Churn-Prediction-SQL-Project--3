Project Name: Customer-Churn-Prediction SQL Project Working with database and tables

ðŸš€ **Problem Statement**

  Telecom companies lose revenue due to customer churn (customers leaving the service).
  The challenge is to analyze customer churn dataset using SQL to understand:
- Which customers are leaving?
- What features influence churn?
- How churn rates vary by demographics and services.

ðŸš€ **Solution**

- We designed a relational database in MySQL with normalized tables for customer churn.
- We then performed data manipulation, querying, filtering, and aggregation to generate insights.

ðŸš€ **concepts used in this project**.

1.	Data manipulation commands in MySQL [create, show, use, drop database]
2.	Define transaction.
3.	Define storage engines and storage engines types.
4.	Creating and managing tables in MySQL 
5.	Perform tasks using these concepts.
6.  Create describe and show table.
7.  alter truncate and drop tables
8.  Inserting and quering data in tables
9.  Filtering data from tables
10. Where and distinct clauses
11. And OR operators 
12. IN, NOT IN operators 
13. BETWEEN and LIKE operators 
14. Limit is null and is not null operator 
15. Table data 
16. sorting 
17. grouping 
18. comments
19. rollup
20. having, groupby, orderby
21. limit operator
22. wildcards
23. subquery, updating, inserting, dropping, rename, truncate


ðŸš€ **Goal**

- Create & manage a churn database.
- Write SQL queries that replicate real-time business questions.
- Apply SQL functions to detect churn patterns.
- Make the project resume-ready for Data Science/Analytics jobs.

ðŸš€ **Tech Stack**

- Database: MySQL
- Language: SQL
- Tools: MySQL Workbench / CLI
- Dataset: Customer Churn (Telco dataset)

ðŸš€ **Tech Used**

- SQL DDL (CREATE, DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE)
- SQL DML (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT)
- Filtering (WHERE, LIKE, BETWEEN, IN, DISTINCT)
- Sorting, Grouping, Aggregate Functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, ROLLUP)
- Subqueries & Joins
- Transactions

ðŸš€ **Key Skills Shown**

- SQL Database Creation & Management
- Data Manipulation (Insert, Update, Delete)
- Filtering & Aggregation
- Advanced Clauses (ROLLUP, HAVING, Subqueries)
- Business Insight Extraction

ðŸš€ **What I Did in this Project**?

- Created a Customer_Churn_DB in MySQL.
- Designed tables like Customers, Services, Contracts.
- Inserted sample data & ran business queries.
- Solved real-time churn queries like:
- % of customers who churned.
- Which contract type has highest churn?
- Which payment method reduces churn?
- Used SQL clauses to get actionable insights.

ðŸš€ **What I Learnt**?

- How to use SQL DDL & DML commands.
- How to filter data using WHERE, LIKE, BETWEEN.
- How to aggregate churn metrics using GROUP BY & HAVING.
- How to join tables & create subqueries.
- How SQL is applied in real-world churn analysis.

ðŸš€ **What is the Impact**?

- Helped business identify customer segments with highest churn risk.
- Improved retention strategies using SQL-driven insights.
- Made my portfolio strong with real-world SQL queries.
